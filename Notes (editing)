How many people should I survey in order to obtain meaningful insight?

1. Population vs sample size:
   Recently I led training for 1,000 staffs. I want to know whether staffs were satisfied with the training.
   Should I survey 1,000 staffs? Do I and they have enough time for this? I decide to survey 200. 
   Am I safe to conclude the overall satisfaction rate of the staffs?  
   
   Population is 1,000. Sample size is 200.
